Due to inclement weather, the hot air balloon rides and food trucks that were scheduled as a part of tomorrow’s Russell Springs Christmas Celebration have been canceled.

The Russell Springs Christmas Parade has been postponed until Saturday, December 7, 2019.

The Masonic Breakfast & Raffle, Gobble ’Til You Wobble 5K, and the Rockland Road Band Concert at the Star Theater will go on tomorrow as planned.
